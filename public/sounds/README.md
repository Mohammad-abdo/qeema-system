# Custom notification sound

Place your notification sound file here as **`notification.mp3`** (or rename your `.wav` to `notification.mp3` if the app only requests that path).

- **File name:** `notification.mp3`
- **Format:** MP3 is recommended; WAV also works if you name it `notification.mp3` (some browsers may require the correct extension).
- **Path used by app:** `/sounds/notification.mp3`

If no file is present, the app falls back to a built-in two-tone chime.
